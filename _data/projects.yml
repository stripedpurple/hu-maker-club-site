# This file lists our various projects

- title: Arcade Cabinet
  description: >
      We are building an arcade cabinet to play retro games on. When it is
      done we will donate it to our university. It uses a Raspberry Pi as
      the brains of the operation.

- title: Laser Harp
  description: >
      One of our future projects will be a laser harp. A laser harp detects
      when a laser is broken and creates a tone based on how that laser was
      broken and the speed of the break.
