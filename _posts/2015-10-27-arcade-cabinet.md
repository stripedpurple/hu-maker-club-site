This is a project that we will be working on in the near future. We are 
currently in the fund raising stage for this project, and any donations 
would be very helpful to make this project a reality.

This project is about building a retro arcade cabinet for the students at 
Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. We will be using a 
raspberry pi as the brains of the operation. It is going to be a full 
sized cabinet, just like the ones from the 70s.

You can donate [here][1].
