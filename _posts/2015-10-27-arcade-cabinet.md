This is a project that we'll be working on in the near future. We are 
currently in the fundraising stage for this project, and any donations 
would be very helpful to make this project a reality.

For this project, we're building a retro arcade cabinet. We'll be using
a raspberry pi as the brains of the operation. It's going to be a full 
sized cabinet, just like the [ones from the 70s][imagesearch]. The cabinet
will be able to play many of your old favorites using [MAME][], as well
as a few modern selections.

This thing isn't going to be cheap, so we'll need all the funding we can
get. If you're interested you can donate at our
[gofundme fundraiser][gofundme].
